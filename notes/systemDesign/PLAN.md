Distributed Systems Basics

Build foundational knowledge of distributed systems.
	1.	Topics to Focus On:
        •	CAP Theorem: Consistency, availability, partition tolerance.
        •	Data Partitioning: Sharding, replication, hashing strategies.
        •	Consistency Models: Strong vs. eventual consistency.
        •	Caching: Strategies, TTL (time to live), cache invalidation.

	3.	Practice Goals:
        •	Draw out how common distributed systems work (e.g., CDN caching, database replication).
        •	Watch Meta’s engineering blog videos on caching and data partitioning.



Systems Design

Goal: Learn to design scalable, fault-tolerant systems.
	1.	Topics to Focus On:
        •	Load Balancers: Role, algorithms, and implementation.
        •	Databases: SQL vs. NoSQL, indexing, replication.
        •	Messaging Queues: Kafka, RabbitMQ, and their use cases.
        •	Scalable Architecture: Horizontal vs. vertical scaling.

    2.  practice 
        •	Week 5: URL shortener, scalable video streaming service.
        •	Week 6: Distributed chat app, global file storage system.



Networking and Operating Systems

Goal: Understand networking protocols and OS-level performance optimizations.
	1.	Topics to Focus On:
        •	Networking: TCP/IP, HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, load balancing.
        •	Operating Systems: Threads, processes, memory management, I/O.

	3.	Practice Goals:
        •	Explain how HTTP requests are processed, from DNS to rendering the webpage.
        •	Debug simple multithreading issues in code or solve OS-level coding problems.



Advanced Topics and Mock Interviews

Goal: Dive deeper into Meta-specific challenges and simulate interviews.
	1.	Topics to Focus On:
        •	Fault Tolerance: Consensus algorithms (Paxos, Raft).
        •	Event-Driven Systems: Pub/Sub models, Kafka deep dive.
        •	Scaling Strategies: Auto-scaling, database sharding.
