Median: 
- The median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations (Manhattan distance). 
- This is because the median is the middle value that balances the distances on either side.

Mean: 
- The mean minimizes the sum of squared deviations (Euclidean distance). 
- This is not suitable for Manhattan distance as it can be skewed by outliers.
