## Relections

I have many unsolved problems still lingering to this day which I could not solve due to TLE or MLE.

Some of these problems can be grouped into one category: subotimal backtracking solutions that could've been solved by DP - but DP could not be used since keeping track of the states required me to use a data structure which was not hashable (thus, not cacheable).

Well, today I finally found a way to get around that issue: bitmask DP. Using a binary, I can now keep track of states efficiently and cacheably, using just a digit. It was simpler than I imagined, and a pretty neat trick.
